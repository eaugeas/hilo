## Etimology
Hilo comes from contracting together high and low. Hilo is pronounced
/haɪloʊ/. There is a term in Spanish, hilo, which means thread. This is not
related to the name of the project. There is another Spanish term, altibajo,
which translates to English as ups and downs, but that translated literally
is high low. So, hilo is the contraction of high low, which in turn is a
literal, even though not correct, translation of altibajo. We believe this
concept is a fine made up adjective to define what an anomaly is.
