## Etimology
Hilo comes from putting together High and Low as High-Low. Hilo is pronounced
/haɪloʊ/. There is a term in Spanish, hilo, which means thread. This is not
related to the name of the project. There is another Spanish term, altibajo,
which translates to English as ups and downs. We believe this concept is a fine
made up adjective to define what an anomaly is.
