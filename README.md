# Hilo
Hilo is an anomaly detection system for time series data.
It ingests input data, trains machine learning models,
and detects anomalies on the data. 

## Etimology
Hilo comes from putting together High and Low as High-Low. Hilo
is pronounced /haɪloʊ/. There is a term in Spanish altibajo, which
translates to English as ups and downs. We believe this concept is
a fine made up adjective to define what an anomaly is.
